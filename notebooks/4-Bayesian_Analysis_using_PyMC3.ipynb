    "Statistical inference is a process of learning from incomplete or imperfect (error-contaminated) data. Can account for this \"imperfection\" using either a sampling model or a measurement error model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Statistical hypothesis testing\n",
    "\n",
    "The *de facto* standard for statistical inference is statistical hypothesis testing. The goal of hypothesis testing is to evaluate a **null hypothesis**. There are two possible outcomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- reject the null hypothesis\n",
    "- fail to reject the null hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "Rejection occurs when a chosen test statistic is higher than some pre-specified threshold valuel; non-rejection occurs otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that neither outcome says anything about the quantity of interest, the **research hypothesis**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Setting up a statistical test involves several subjective choices by the user that are rarely justified based on the problem or decision at hand:\n",
    "\n",
    "- statistical test to use\n",
    "- null hypothesis to test\n",
    "- significance level\n",
    "\n",
    "Choices are often based on arbitrary criteria, including \"statistical tradition\" (Johnson 1999). The resulting evidence is indirect, incomplete, and typically overstates the evidence against the null hypothesis (Goodman 1999).\n",
    "\n",
    "Most importantly to applied users, the results of statistical hypothesis tests are very easy to misinterpret. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Estimation \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of testing, a more informative and effective approach for inference is based on **estimation** (be it frequentist or Bayesian). That is, rather than testing whether two groups are different, we instead pursue an estimate of *how different* they are, which is fundamentally more informative. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we include an estimate of **uncertainty** associated with that difference which includes uncertainty due to our lack of knowledge of the model parameters (*epistemic uncertainty*) and uncertainty due to the inherent stochasticity of the system (*aleatory uncertainty*)."

    "$$\\mu \\sim N(0, 10^2)$$\n",
